    "text": "1.1 Summary\n\n1.1.1 Overview of remote sensing\nRemote sensing is a technology that senses and measures information on the earth’s surface over long distances. It is now frequently used to obtain accurate and timely information, and most remote sensing data are analyzed using digital image processing techniques (Jensen, 2015).\n\n\n1.1.2 Sensor types\n\nPassive: Receive energy reflected from the sun\nActive: Actively emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive\n\n\n\n\nDifference between passive and active sensors (The Nature Conservancy, n/d)\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Electromagnetic radiation(EMR) interacts with Earth’s surface\nEnergy can be absorbed and transmitted.\nTwo forms:\n\nSurface scattering\nAtmospheric scattering\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Big issue caused by scattering\n\n1.1.4.1 Problem\nClouds: Impact on remote sensing applications\n\n\n1.1.4.2 Solution\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n\nIt is an active microwave remote sensing technology\nIt is not limited by weather conditions, cloud cover, or nighttime\nValuable for geological exploration, land use monitoring, disaster assessment\n\n\n\n1.1.4.3 Conclusion\nThe sun’s energy interacts with the Earth’s surface in many ways, affecting the creation and use of data.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Remote sensing data\n\n1.1.5.1 Data formats\n\nData format: Raster\nCommon data storage format: GeoTIFF\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 Data resolution\n\nSpatial: The size of the raster cells\nSpectral: The number of bands, and each band is usually provided as a separate raster layer\nTemporal: The revisit time of the sensor\nRadiometric: The ability of a sensor to identify and show small differences in energy\n\n\n\n\n1.1.6 How to select data\n\nEnvironmental constraints\n\nResearch area\nResearch question\nresearch Fund (cost)\n…\n\nSensor constraints\n\nSize of features\nSpectral sensitivity\nDate range\nQuality of the image\nType of orbit\n…\n\n\n\n\n1.1.7 Practical\n\n1.1.7.1 Use Tasseled Cap transformation for analysis\n\nTasseled Cap function\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nBrightness = 0.3037(B2)+0.2793(B3)+\\\\0.4743(B4)+0.5585(B8)+\\\\\n0.5082(B11)+0.1863(B12)\n\\end{split}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{split}\nGreeness = −0.2848(B2)−0.2435(B3)\\\\−0.5436(B4)+0.7243(B8)+\\\\\n0.0840(B11)−0.1800(B12)\n\\end{split}\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{split}\nWetness = 0.1509(B2)+0.1973(B3)\\\\+0.3279(B4)+0.3406(B8)\\\\−\n0.7112(B11)−0.4572(B12)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nMasking and resampling\n\n\nResample bands 2,3,4 and 8 to 20m\nClip the raster to the City of Capetown polygon\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\nTasseled Cap transformation result\n\n\nIt can be found from the figure:\n\nBrightness reflects bare soil, artificial surfaces, bright materials\nGreenness reflects green vegetation\nWetness reflects moisture\n\n\n\n1.1.7.2 Spectral signatures of POIs\nLand cover types of POIs:\n\nBare earth\ngrass\nForest\nHigher reflective urban\nLower reflective urban\n\n\n\n\nA: Line graph of spectral characteristics B: Density distribution plot of spectral features"
