# Week 1 - An Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Summary

This section will summarize the content of first week of remote sensing course, which is some basic remote sensing knowledge, including how to obtain remote sensing images, image features, etc. Some key points are listed below.

### Overview of remote sensing

Remote sensing is a technology that senses and measures information on the earth's surface over long distances. It is now frequently used to obtain accurate and timely information, and most remote sensing data are analyzed using digital image processing techniques [@Jensen2015].

### Sensor types

1.  Passive: Receive energy reflected from the sun

2.  Active: Actively emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive

### Electromagnetic radiation(EMR) interacts with Earth's surface

Energy can be absorbed and transmitted.

Two forms:

1.  Surface scattering

2.  Atmospheric scattering

### Big issue caused by scattering

#### Problem

Clouds: Impact on remote sensing applications

#### Solution

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

-   It is an active microwave remote sensing technology

-   It is not limited by weather conditions, cloud cover, or nighttime

-   Valuable for geological exploration, land use monitoring, disaster assessment

#### Conclusion

The sun's energy interacts with the Earth's surface in many ways, affecting the creation and use of data.

### Remote sensing data

#### Data formats

-   Data format: Raster

-   Common data storage format: GeoTIFF

#### Data resolution

1.  Spatial: The size of the raster cells

2.  Spectral: The number of bands, and each band is usually provided as a separate raster layer

3.  Temporal: The revisit time of the sensor

4.  Radiometric: The ability of a sensor to identify and show small differences in energy

### Practical

#### Use Tasseled Cap transformation for analysis

1.  Tasseled Cap function

$$
\begin{split}
Brightness = 0.3037(B2)+0.2793(B3)+\\0.4743(B4)+0.5585(B8)+\\
0.5082(B11)+0.1863(B12)
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
Greeness = −0.2848(B2)−0.2435(B3)\\−0.5436(B4)+0.7243(B8)+\\
0.0840(B11)−0.1800(B12)
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
Wetness = 0.1509(B2)+0.1973(B3)\\+0.3279(B4)+0.3406(B8)\\−
0.7112(B11)−0.4572(B12)
\end{split}
$$

2.  Masking and resampling

-   Resample bands 2,3,4 and 8 to 20m
-   Clip the raster to the City of Capetown polygon

3.  Result

![Tasseled Cap transformation result](figure/Brightness_Greeness_Wetness_2.jpg){width="80%"}

It can be found from the figure:

-   Brightness reflects bare soil, artificial surfaces, bright materials
-   Greenness reflects green vegetation
-   Wetness reflects moisture

#### Spectral signatures of POIs

Land cover types of POIs:

-   Bare earth
-   grass
-   Forest
-   Higher reflective urban
-   Lower reflective urban

![A: Line graph of spectral characteristics B: Density distribution plot of spectral features](figure/spectral_reflectance.jpg){width="80%"}

It can be seen from the results that different POIs have different performances on different bands, and high urban has a larger difference than other POIs. Specific areas can be detected or classified through differences in band values in different areas, or by combining the values of several bands.

## Applications

In the first week of study, I am most interested in Tasseled Cap transformation (TCT). It converts spectral information in remote sensing images into brightness, greenness, and wetness components, which can be applied in many fields.

Specifically, TCT can help extract water bodies by obtaining the greenness and wetness components of remote sensing images, and can reduce the impact of shadows, dense vegetation and buildings [@Chen2020; @Chen2022; @Zhuang2018]. By considering the characteristics of coastline morphology and the greenness and wetness components, the TCT can also be used to extract coastline information, particularly in areas with high sediment concentration [@Chen2019].One study [@Wang2003] compared the TCT method with a Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network and a conventional rule-based method for water body extraction from Landsat 4 satellite images. It was found that the error of thresholding on the wetness in the TCT method is too large to be practical for this purpose. This suggests that while TCT can be useful for various remote sensing applications, its effectiveness for water body extraction may be limited under certain conditions or compared to other specialized methods.

Components of TCT, such as brightness, greenness, and wetness, can provide valuable information about the condition and changes in forest vegetation over time [@Stoyanov2022; @Liu2019; @Liu2019a], also monitor the health of the forest [@Liu2009]. But the TCT parameters need to be recalculated for different sensors or spectral data, enabling more accurate classification of vegetation patches, crop types, and changes in forest health. Moreover, an innovative approach involved modeling post-fire forest regrowth using TCT-derived indicators [@Stankova2023]. This methodology leverages the TCT to increase the identification of components (soil, vegetation, and moisture) changing during a fire, thereby providing a cost-effective tool for monitoring the recovery of burnt forests.

## Reflections

Overall, the first week was heavy and covered many basic concepts of remote sensing data, but it was not difficult in terms of understanding. These basics were important to me as a beginner in remote sensing because it gave me a clear understanding of the sources and structure of remotely sensed data and laid the foundation for subsequent courses.

Although I was a bit overwhelmed when I first came across SNAP as a software, with a little bit of research on remote sensing data, I successfully used SNAP to get satisfactory analysis results. In addition, thanks to the emergence of packages such as stars and terra, it is easier and faster to analyse a large amount of remote sensing data in a unified way using R language, and the results can be presented in a more beautiful way. Therefore, for me personally, I prefer to use R for analyses. Maybe on the one hand it's because I'm more familiar with R language programming, and on the other hand it's because using R allows me to get clearer logic. Of course, the trade-off for this is that processing data with R does take time.

As a carrier of earth surface information, remote sensing images contain a huge amount of information. Through spectral analysis in different bands, we can identify the type and health of vegetation and monitor trends in urban expansion. With the advancement of technology, high-resolution images allow us to compare remote sensing images at different points in time and clearly see changes in the earth's surface. Remote sensing technology has greatly promoted the development of environmental monitoring, urban planning, agricultural development, disaster management and other fields. Its wide range of application scenarios makes me eager to learn more.
