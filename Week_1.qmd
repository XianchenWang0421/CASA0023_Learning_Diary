# Week 1 - An Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Summary

### Overview of remote sensing

Remote sensing is a technology that senses and measures information on the earth's surface over long distances. It is now frequently used to obtain accurate and timely information, and most remote sensing data are analyzed using digital image processing techniques [@Jensen2015].

### Sensor types

1.  Passive: Receive energy reflected from the sun

2.  Active: Actively emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive

### Electromagnetic radiation(EMR) interacts with Earth's surface

Energy can be absorbed and transmitted.

Two forms:

1.  Surface scattering

2.  Atmospheric scattering

### Big issue caused by scattering

#### Problem

Clouds: Impact on remote sensing applications

#### Solution

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

-   It is an active microwave remote sensing technology

-   It is not limited by weather conditions, cloud cover, or nighttime

-   Valuable for geological exploration, land use monitoring, disaster assessment

#### Conclusion

The sun's energy interacts with the Earth's surface in many ways, affecting the creation and use of data.

### Remote sensing data

#### Data formats

-   Data format: Raster

-   Common data storage format: GeoTIFF

#### Data resolution

1.  Spatial: The size of the raster cells

2.  Spectral: The number of bands, and each band is usually provided as a separate raster layer

3.  Temporal: The revisit time of the sensor

4.  Radiometric: The ability of a sensor to identify and show small differences in energy

### How to select data

-   Environmental constraints

    -   Research area

-   Sensor constraints

    -   Size of features

    -   Spectral sensitivity

    -   Date range

    -   Quality of the image

    -   Type of orbit

    -   ...

### Practical

#### Use Tasseled Cap transformation for analysis

1.  Tasseled Cap function

$$
\begin{split}
Brightness = 0.3037(B2)+0.2793(B3)+\\0.4743(B4)+0.5585(B8)+\\
0.5082(B11)+0.1863(B12)
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
Greeness = −0.2848(B2)−0.2435(B3)\\−0.5436(B4)+0.7243(B8)+\\
0.0840(B11)−0.1800(B12)
\end{split}
$$

$$
\begin{split}
Wetness = 0.1509(B2)+0.1973(B3)\\+0.3279(B4)+0.3406(B8)\\−
0.7112(B11)−0.4572(B12)
\end{split}
$$

2.  Masking and resampling

-   Resample bands 2,3,4 and 8 to 20m
-   Clip the raster to the City of Capetown polygon

3.  Result

![Tasseled Cap transformation result](figure/Brightness_Greeness_Wetness_2.jpg){width="80%"}

It can be found from the figure:

-   Brightness reflects bare soil, artificial surfaces, bright materials
-   Greenness reflects green vegetation
-   Wetness reflects moisture

#### Spectral signatures of POIs

Land cover types of POIs:

-   Bare earth
-   grass
-   Forest
-   Higher reflective urban
-   Lower reflective urban
