abstract = {For junior/graduate-level courses in Remote Sensing in Geography, Geology, Forestry, and Biology. Introductory Digital Image Processing: A Remote Sensing Perspective focuses on digital image processing of aircraft- and satellite-derived, remotely sensed data for Earth resource management applications. Extensively illustrated, it explains how to extract biophysical information from remote sensor data for almost all multidisciplinary land-based environmental projects. Part of the Pearson Series Geographic Information Science. Now in full color, the Fourth Edition provides up-to-date information on analytical methods used to analyze digital remote sensing data. Each chapter contains a substantive reference list that can be used by students and scientists as a starting place for their digital image processing project or research. A new appendix provides sources of imagery and other geospatial information.}
