# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This is the learning diary of the CASA0023 (Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments).

Personal introduction:

Hello, I am Xianchen Wang. Currently a student at the Center for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL, I am doing a master's program.

In the past, I obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science and conducted some research work in the direction of deep learning. I have a high research interest in data science, especially urban spatial data. The main purpose of choosing the remote sensing course is to supplement some prior knowledge that I don't know. I think this will be helpful for my future research.

This website records the content, thoughts and gains during my learning process. The subject of remote sensing contains very rich content, and I will do some exploration in aspects that interest me. If you have any questions about this website, please feel free to contact me.
